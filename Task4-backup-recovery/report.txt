TASK 4 – DATABASE BACKUP AND RECOVERY REPORT

In this task, we focused on the concept of database backup and recovery. 
A backup copy of the main table was created to ensure data safety. 
To simulate data loss, records were intentionally deleted from the main table. 
The recovery process was then performed by restoring the data from the backup table. 
This demonstrated that even if data is lost or corrupted, it can be safely recovered using proper backup strategies. 
All steps were implemented using SQL scripts and the process ensures data integrity. 
Due to environment limitations, the backup and recovery were demonstrated conceptually rather than using actual database servers.
